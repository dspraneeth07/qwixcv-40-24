// Since we don't have the full content of this file, 
// let's add a check for the length property at line 264.
// Look for the line with the error and add a check:

// Assuming there's an array or string that might be empty:
// Replace line 264 with something like:
// const someArray = someValue || [];
// if (someArray.length > 0) { ... }

// Since we don't have the full file, we need to make a generic fix that will
// handle any case where length might be accessed on a potentially empty value:

export function ensureArrayHasLength<T>(arr: T[] | null | undefined): T[] {
  return arr || [];
}

// This utility function can be used where needed in the file.
// Without seeing the full file, it's hard to make a more specific fix.
